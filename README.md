Project 1: Customer Satisfaction In The Airline Industry – Southeast Airlines

Program: R/RStudio

This project was the culmination of my first course in the data science program, IST 687 - Introduction to Data Science. This course is designed to introduce 
the fundamentals of data science and the processes of effective business application. Throughout the course we learned a broad overview of business function 
surrounding the technologies used in the field, handling data, and the most efficient way to convey actionable insights through visualization techniques. For my 
term project for the course, my team decided to extrapolate insights around a large set of airline satisfaction data, which was a grouping of customer feedback data
pulled from a survey. The Dataset contains about 129889 responses (rows) from airline customers survey throughout 3 months, and contains data from 14 airlines. The 
Dataset has 28 columns, which consist of data obtained from surveys submitted by its airline customers. The columns broadly focus on several categories, including 
customer’s gender, age, number of flights, shopping amount at the airport, type of travel, etc. For the purpose of our project, we decided to act as a consultant 
to a particular company, Southeast Airlines. The following steps, I will dive into the data cleansing, manipulating, and insights we extrapolated from our term work.

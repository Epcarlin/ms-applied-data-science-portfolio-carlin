Project 3: Where Does Our Garbage Go?

Program: R/RStudio

Abstract: This project exemplifies a very detailed level of presentation and visualization side of data science. Information Visualization (IST 719) is designed to introduce students to a broad array of visualization techniques for effective communication through the R programming language and Adobe Illustrator. Learning about visual cues, the golden ratio and overall formatting were a large part of the final presentation. For my term project and for a focus on this section, I decided to take an exploratory look into United States Landfill data to get an idea on how the politics and management of waste was being handled over the last century. We dive into specific landfills to discuss how regional management criteria has influenced the overall secondary waste.

Upon completing my Bachelor of Science in Economics with a minor in Applied Statistics from Syracuse University in the spring of 2018, I started my program into the Masters of Applied Data Science. As a young professional now in my second year working as a Marketing Analyst in the financial space, I truly understand the importance of utilizing our data and expanding on processes / applying what I’ve learned throughout the program to push our business forward. Applying functions of descriptive and predictive analytics to the marketing field is vital in understanding our audience from a qualitative angle within our data warehouse, forecasting product performance, expanding our reach through technical processes and use of various software’s, reporting to the executive teams with concise and effective communications, building our repeatable functions to run reporting, and overall increasing the understanding of our data is key to my current position. Throughout the following program project, I will dive into a few key courses and explain how each armed me with the tools to become a technical employee in the field of marketing/data science.

Throughout the following branches of this repository, you will find 4 projects that I have completed throughout my studies in the program, that I feel have given me the skills to become an effective and efficient data science within my career.

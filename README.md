Project 2: Calculating Weather Delays at Airports 

Programs: Python

Abstract: Calculating Weather Delays at Airports was the final term project for IST 718: Big Data Analytics. The course overview is designed to cover analytical processing tools and techniques for handling big data. Utlizing R and Python programming languages, the course is designed to encompass all facets of data analytics, from the initial data discovery and descriptive data analytics, to predictive modeling and interpretation. The main goal of our project is to minimize the revenue lost due to weather cancellations and delays at airports. This research and analysis will help us fully interpret and understand the relationship between flight cancellations and the reasoning behind them. By narrowing our scope to six major airports nationwide, we analyzed and interpreted specific weather and airport data. Using descriptive statistics, graphic representation, and various modeling techniques, we map a strategy that would lead to a new design of flight scheduling and forecasting based off sound analytics. Working through the manipulation and fitting of our data, we plan to have a clear view of what variables are correlated to cancellations, and then produce recommendations based on our findings.
